output_por_disp_01
    - no dispersivity
output_por_disp_02
    - no dispersivity
    - increase porosity 0.8
output_por_disp_03
    - increase porosity 0.8
output_deep_mesh_100fr
    - test of deep mesh, new extraxt results, same as "output_por_disp_02"
    - (output_tuesday_05), 1000s, 212s failed, 10s probably killed
    
    
notes:
tuesday:
01 - 10 samples, same configuration as "output_por_disp_02", new extraxt results
02 - same as "tuesday_01", lower bulk conductivities by factor 10
03 - same as "tuesday_01", lower bulk conductivities by factor 2
04 - same as 01, running on charon_2h
06 - same as "output_por_disp_02", new extraxt results
